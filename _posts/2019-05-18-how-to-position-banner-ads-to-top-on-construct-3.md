We are building HTML5 and Mobile games with Construct 3 and we are using default Mobile Advert plugin which does not have any banner ads position option.

I've looked for it and there is no option available for banner ad position, so I wanted to try export the game as Android Studio project because it must use Native Android Ads SDK or something.

I've search for **BOTTOM** keyword because banner ads only sit to bottom. And Yes I've found it then change it to **TOP** then build in Android Studio, 

So now we have damn top banner ads on our game.
